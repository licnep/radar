# Project Specs

Need to develop a registration page for a service with a monthly subscription, using Paypal, and offering a one month free trial.

- One landing page, with 2 buttons, login or register
- Registration page, where user can enter name, surname, email, password, or use facebook login (check that email is properly formatted and that all fields are compiled)
- A Mysql database containing all user details
- After registering you are sent to a paypal page to allow the monthly subscription (10 euros), with a free initial month
- A placeholder page only accessible to logged-in users, with a logout button
- An account management page, where the user can change his password or cancel the subscription

##### Technologies: Javascript, Paypal, PHP, Google Cloud (linux server), MySQL
##### Design: dark background
